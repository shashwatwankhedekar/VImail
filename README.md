### 📚 Tech stack
- VS Code 
- Google Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech APIs
- HTML/CSS

### ⚙ WorkingThrough this Web Application the
Vision Impaired user can get a speech synthesized outputof the mails in his inbox or can view his email using themagnifier option available. To compose emails he can give a input to the system by using the Braille keyboard.
Text to speech synthesizer which converts the text format of the emails to synthesized speech. Predicting the correct intonation (how the pitch pattern or fundamental frequency changes during speech), stress and duration from the plain text is a challenging task.

### 🔑 KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
1) User friendly ( as a blind person can easily use web based application )
2) Easy storage of data
3) More efficient
4) Requires less effort and time
5) The system that we are developing is entirely different from the existing ones.Unlike other systems which focus only on a particular set of people our system is focussed mainly on visually challenged people .

### 🌈 CONCLUSION
This Web based application which will help the visually impaired people to access the email services easily and efficiently. This system will help in overcoming certain issues that the visually impaired people had to face earlier in using email systems. Also we have completely eliminated the concept of using keyboard shortcuts and also the use of screen readers which may help in reducing the stress load of remembering the location of the keys on the keyboard and so that user can use this system efficiently. The user is only supposed to follow the instructions which will be given by Google speech technology.

### FUTURE PROSPECT
-To make our WebApp more useful and convenient, we plan on adding a more features.
